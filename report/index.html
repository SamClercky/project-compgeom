    <h2>Description of the project</h2>

    <p>
        The project aims to investigate various algorithms for decomposing a simple polygon into its convex
        subcomponents. Five different algorithms are explored, accompanied by an examination of their overall
        strategies. Two approach involve avoiding the addition of extra points, commonly referred to as Steiner
        points. The two algorithms that are discussed here within this paradigm are simple triangulation and
        greedy decomposition. Another strategy permits the addition of extra
        points to ease the decomposition process. For this, the Chazelle algorithm, slab
        decomposition, and KD decomposition are going to be implemented and discussed.
    </p>

    <p>
        To demonstrate an example of an application of the different decompositions,
        a Minkowski sums algorithm will be implemented. The initial phase of this algorithm involves decomposing the
        polygons, with which the sum will be calculated. Reducing the
        number of decomposition components here will generally result in better
        performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, a more thorough description of the application's various components and implemented algorithms will be
        presented.
    </p>

    <h3>Doubly Connected Edge List</h3>
    <small><strong>By Célian Glénaz and Andreas Declerck</strong></small>
    <p>
        Prior to initiating the implementation of any decomposition algorithm, we have to determine the most suitable
        representation for polygons and their decompositions. In the description of the triangulation algorithm, a
        recommended structure is proposed: a doubly connected edge list. After some research, it seems that it is the
        best choice for our application. It accommodates complex arrangements of edges, vertices and faces that can
        represent a decomposed polygon. Furthermore, you can easily add new edges or vertices. Finally, the structure
        allows for efficient iteration over faces, facilitating the extraction of generated convex shapes by traversing
        their borders.
    </p>
    <p>
        We chose to implement our own DCEL class to enhance our understanding of its workings. It is composed of three
        classes: DCFace, DCHalfEdge and DCVertex, corresponding to the fundamental components of the DCEL. The DCEL
        class features two main methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>getPrevEdgeOfFace(DCVertex, DCFace): get the previous edge of a given face in the counter-clockwise order
            (used in triangulation)
        </li>

        <li>addVertex(DCHalfEdge, PVector): insert a vertex at a given position in a given half edge (used in KD and
            slab decomposition)</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Triangulation</h3>
    <small><strong>By Célian Glénaz</strong></small>
    <p>
        Our implementation of triangulation relies on the line-sweep algorithms covered in the course. The first part
        involves partitioning a simple polygon into multiple Y-monotone polygons by adding carefully chosen edges. At
        the end of this stage, the boundary of each face in the DCEL is a
        y-monotone polygon. Here is an illustrative example from our application at this stage:
    </p>
    <img src="figures/Ymonotone.png" alt="Y-monotone decomposition">
    <p>
        Then the second part is splitting these polygons into triangles by using another line sweep algorithm with a
        stack. The result for the same polygon looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="figures/triangulated.png" alt="Triangulation">

    <p>
        For our test examples, the result is the following:
    </p>

    <img src="figures/tri-zaag.png">

    <h3>Greedy Decomposition</h3>
    <small><strong>By Célian Glénaz</strong></small>
    <p>
        This decomposition leverages the triangulation algorithm but halts as soon as there are no more reflex vertices
        in the polygon. It is implemented by introducing a <i>greedy</i> boolean variable as an argument of the
        triangulation methods and a <i>reflexVertices</i> list in DCEL.Upon the addition of each edge, the reflex
        vertices are updated. If the list becomes empty, the program checks whether the greedy mode is activated, and if
        so, it returns. The process may halt in the monotone decomposition or in any of the triangulations.
        Nevertheless, when a reflex vertex is positioned at the bottom of the decomposed polygon, the result is the same
        as the regular triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
        For our test examples, the result is the following:

    <h3>Slab Decomposition</h3>
    <small><strong>By Andreas Declerck</strong></small>

    <p>
        The slab decomposition algorithm is described in <c-cite src="agarwal_polygon_2002" />.
        It works by choosing a direction in which to cut and then, on every reflex
        point, cutting the polygon up and down following the initial chosen
        direction. For the implementation, only cutting along the y-axis is handled.
    </p>

    <p>
        The way this algorithm is implemented is by taking a polygon, categorizing
        all vertices of this simple polygon into the following categories: start, end,
        split, join, reflex point and other points. This information is then used in a
        sweep line algorithm that travels perpendicular to the initial direction
        over the field with the vertices as its events. This is done to maintain a list
        of edges above and below a certain point, so only a limited amount of edges need
        to be tested for intersection. Once an edge above or below a reflex point has been
        found, a cut will be made along the initially chosen direction.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this algorithm, all events are used to update the sweep line structure, and
        maintain an ordered list of all edges currently intersecting with the sweep line.
        The vertices considered reflex points are the vertices that are classified as
        either a split, a join or a reflex point.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a time complexity analysis, categorizing all points and adding them
        to an event queue results in O(n log n). As we need to iterate through
        all points and then put them into a priority queue. Insertion of a cut
        is O(E) with E the number of edges of the part of the polygon that has
        not been cut. The final time complexity of this algorithm is then O(E n + p)
        with E the number of edges in the polygon and n the number of events
        that represent reflex points and p the number of events that do not
        represent reflex points.

    <h3>KD Decomposition</h3>
    <small><strong>By Andreas Declerck</strong></small>

    <p>
        The KD decomposition is described in <c-cite src="agarwal_polygon_2002" />,
        and has been inspired by KD trees sometimes used to accelerate
        raytracing algorithms <c-cite src="pharr_pbrt_2023" />. The basic idea is
        to subdivide space by first sorting all points along all axes (x,y) and
        then each step taking the median along one of these axes and subdividing
        along this axis through the selected point.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the KD decomposition algorithm, this results in first finding all
        reflex points in the polygon and sorting them along the x- and y-axes.
        Every iteration, the median of the sorted reflex points is selected along
        the current axis. The polygon is then cut along this axis through the
        median point. The resulting pieces after the cut are then handled
        recursively until no more reflex points can be found while alternating
        the selected axis.
    </p>

    <p>
        A invariant that needs to be taken into account, is that once a
        reflex point has been used for a cut, it is not reused for a cut along
        another axis.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the time complexity analysis of this algorithm: Finding all the reflex
        points is O(n) and sorting them along all the axis's is O(n log(n)). For
        the meat of the algorithm, first finding the median along an axis region
        is O(1) ((start + end) / 2). Finding one or possibly two opposite sides
        for making a cut, is done by iterating over all the edges of the faces adjacent to
        the current reflex point. If an edge intersects with the direction of
        the cut, is visible from inside the polygon by the current reflex point and
        is the closest intersection seen from the current reflex point, a cut is
        made from the current reflex point to the intersection with the line
        along the current axis through the current reflex point and the found
        edge. This cut can be made in O(E) with E the number of edges in the common
        face between the reflex point and the cut's destination. Finding the cut's
        destination is O(FE) with F the adjacent faces to the reflex point and E
        the number of edges in these adjacent faces. As it is not guaranteed that
        the cut evenly divides the polygon every time, resulting in having to search
        faces that do not really reduce in size with every cut. This leads to a worst
        case time complexity of n*O(n)=O(n^2). But when considering more favorable
        polygons where cutting, splits a face into two more equal parts, it can be said
        that the amortized time becomes O(n log n).

    <h3>Chazelle P-time decomposition algorithm</h3>
    <small><strong>By Mevel Gilles</strong></small>

    <p>
        The Chazelle decomposition algorithm is described in <c-cite src="chazelle_decomposing_1979" />.
        The algorithm is based on identifying patterns in the polygon, leading to an efficient decomposition using said
        patterns. First, we must identify
        the notches (equivalent to a reflex point) of the polygon, which will later be used as a basic component in the
        pattern identification.
    </p>

    <p>
        The notion of Xk-pattern is then introduced as an element interconnecting k notches, forming a set of k polygons
        and removing all reflex points occurring at those k notches.
        No new notch is introduced by the Xk-patterns.
        The final solution will then be made out of all the possible Xk-patterns found in the polygon.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only the Xk-pattern and subsequent decompositions is considered in the paper, but it is important to note that
        Chazelle also identifies Yk-patterns.
        These Yk-patterns are derived from the Xk-patterns and used to further improve the final decomposition.
    </p>

    <p>
        The vast majority of the work done in this part of the project involves the pre-processing step of the Chazelle
        algorithm.
        This step consists in identifying specific segments and points in the polygon, by grouping together 3 different
        notches of the polygon (named Vi, Vj, Vk in the paper).
        One can imagine these 3 points positioned in a triangle, where other notches can sit in between each pair of
        points. The pre-processing will then generate 2 segments between
        each points of (Vi, Vj, Vk) in a left and right manner. For each of these points, 2 segments, l' and r'
        (respectively left and right) are generated (following the specific procedure
        described in the paper). For each of these segments, their intersections are also computed, and their
        coordinates are registered as M-points. An additional sub-step requires to
        check whether the M-points and the associated l' and r' all sit inside the polygon. All these lines and
        intersections can be computed in O(N(P)) where N(P) denotes the number of notches in the polygon P.
    </p>

    <p>
        All the previously computed l' and r' segments as well as M-points are used to try and identify specific
        patterns in the polygon. 2 specific Xk-patterns are considered in the code:

    <ul>
        <li>The X2-patterns, separating the polygon into 2 sub-polygons which union reduces the number of notches by 2.
        </li>
        <li>The X3-patterns, separating the polygon into 4 sub-polygons which union reduces the number of notches by 3.
        </li>
    </ul>

    It is important to note that the original intent of the X3-patterns is to introduce 3 sub-polygons, and not 4. In
    the scope of this project, inner sub-polygons
    (sub-polygons which have no edges in the hull of the polygon) are kept. However a 'relatively simple' procedure
    could improve this further: Compute the center of the triangle formed by the X3-pattern (the inner sub-polygon)
    and "push" the edges of the inner sub-polygon inwards until they all meet at the center point. This would increase
    the area of the 3 surrounding sub-polygons without introducing any new notch and effectively remove
    the center sub-polygon as it would simply disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
        The final step of this part of the project is to split the polygon into its convex components using the computed
        patterns. Again, the original intent was to make use of the Yk-patterns, but a simple greedy procedure
        will be used instead as the amount of time required to implement the entirety of the paper was simply too much
        for me alone. The greedy procedure will start with all the X3-patterns first, as they have
        the potential to maximize the number of removed notches for a minimum of introduced sub-polygon. Every time a
        new X3-pattern is considered, the algorithm verifies that this specific X3-pattern (i.e. the 3 points involved)
        can be used to split the polygon. Every time the polygon is split into sub parts, any other X3-pattern might not
        be usable as their points might now be scattered among different sub-polygons.

        Finally, the X2-patterns are considered, following the same logic. Once all sub convex components have been
        computed, they are returned by the algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is an example of the result of the Chazelle decomposition, considering only X2 and X3-patterns:

    <h3>Minkowski sum algorithm</h3>
    <small><strong>By Célian Glénaz</strong></small>

    <p>
        According to <c-cite src="agarwal_polygon_2002" />, calculating Minkowski sums can be done in three steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Decompose the input polygons <b>P</b> and <b>Q</b> into convex subpolygons <b>P1, P2, ..., Ps</b> and <b>Q1,
                Q2, ..., Qt</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            For each i,j compute the Minkowski subsum of <b>Pi</b> and <b>Qj</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Construct the union of all the polygons from previous step.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Therefore, after choosing the decomposition algorithm, we have to compute the minkowski sum of two convex
        polygons. <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/geometry/minkowski.html">This article</a> explains everything we
        need to know about this subject. They also provide this illustration:
    </p>

    <img alt="Visual" src="https://cp-algorithms.com/geometry/minkowski.gif">


    <p>
        When both polygon are convex, the edges of their Minkowki sum are the combined edges of both polygons, sorted by
        polar angles. Since in a convex polygon the edges are already sorted by polar angle, we can iterate
        simultaneously on both polygons edges and get the lower element at each iteration. To compare two edges we can
        use the orientation of (origin, edge1, edge1+edge2).
    </p>


    <!-- <p>
        For the union part, since we do not use the Minkowski sum to compute other things like collisions, we do not
        have to implement it. We can just draw every minkowski subsum with transparency in order to help us understand
        the result.
    </p> -->

    <p>
        For educational purposes, the union of the Minkowski subsums where drawn individually with a transparent
        background. This allows the observer to see how the individual parts of a polygon have been modified by the
        summation, and shows visually the impact of the decomposition on the final result.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the example, we took the slab decomposition of the saw pattern and calculated the Minkowski sum with a small
        circle.
    </p>
    <img src="figures/slab-zaag.png">
    <img src="figures/minkowski-slab-zaag.png">
    <img src="figures/triangulation-curl-square.png">
    <p>
        The "tips" are rounded, and we can see overlaps in every edge added by
        the decomposition. This demonstrates why the Minkowski sum is used to
        find paths between obstacles for a moving robot. The area of the sum
        would be an area where a round robot would hit the obstacle. The second
        example is the Minkowski sum of the triangulation of a curved shape and
        a small square. We selected simple forms and decompositions because
        otherwise it becomes quite difficult to comprehend the result of the
        Minkowski sum.
    </p>

    <h3>GUI</h3>
    <small><strong>By Andreas Declerck</strong></small>

    <p>
        The GUI is made with Processing in Java for the drawing and interactive parts and
        uses Swing for all other menus. It contains a custom layout engine to position
        the buttons dynamically in the menu and displays metrics about a certain
        decomposition.
    </p>

    <p>
        For easy testing and experimenting, it is possible to save and reopen a polygon.
        Saving is done by storing the points of the polygon in a custom file format.
        Doing this allows to experiment with different types of polygons on an automated
        testing bed.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    The triangulation algorithm is composed of fewer vertices and edges than other decompositions, but the result looks
    less natural than slab decomposition, for example. The greedy mode doesn't provide much improvements on the test
    shown but reduces the number of edges most of the time in other polygons. Slab and KD decompositions create less
    faces and will therefore be more efficient for some use cases like calculating minkowski sums (on the union step).
