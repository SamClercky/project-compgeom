	abstract = {This thesis studies the application of optimization methods in approximating geometric shapes. In particular, it considers the problem of finding maximum volume (axis-aligned) inscribed parallelotopes and boxes  in a compact convex set, defined by a finite number of convex inequalities, and presents an optimization approach for solving them. Several optimization models are developed that can be easily generalized to find other inscribed geometric shapes such as triangles, rhombi, and tetrahedrons. To find the largest axis-aligned inscribed rectangles in the higher dimensions, an interior-point method algorithm is presented and analyzed. Finally, a parametrized optimization approach is developed to find the largest (axis-aligned) inscribed rectangles in the two-dimensional space.},

	abstract = {Approximate convex decomposition aims to decompose a 3D shape into a set of almost convex components, whose convex hulls can then be used to represent the input shape. It thus enables efficient geometry processing algorithms specifically designed for convex shapes and has been widely used in game engines, physics simulations, and animation. While prior works can capture the global structure of input shapes, they may fail to preserve fine-grained details (e.g., filling a toaster's slots), which are critical for retaining the functionality of objects in interactive environments. In this paper, we propose a novel method that addresses the limitations of existing approaches from three perspectives: (a) We introduce a novel collision-aware concavity metric that examines the distance between a shape and its convex hull from both the boundary and the interior. The proposed concavity preserves collision conditions and is more robust to detect various approximation errors. (b) We decompose shapes by directly cutting meshes with 3D planes. It ensures generated convex hulls are intersection-free and avoids voxelization errors. (c) Instead of using a one-step greedy strategy, we propose employing a multi-step tree search to determine the cutting planes, which leads to a globally better solution and avoids unnecessary cuttings. Through extensive evaluation on a large-scale articulated object dataset, we show that our method generates decompositions closer to the original shape with fewer components. It thus supports delicate and efficient object interaction in downstream applications.},
